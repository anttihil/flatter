# flatter
A minimalist forum app built with React and NodeJS. I aim for having a flatter structure with less visual clutter on the front-end. Traditional forums often have a tree-like structure where finding the active threads is a bit of a hassle. Similarly, comment threads often have a sprawling nested structure. I plan to avoid some of this by implementing a different user interface.
