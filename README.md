# flatter

A minimalist message board site built with NodeJS, Express, Pug, and TailwindCSS.

The Express app includes user authentication with Passport. The database is PostgreSQL and is interfaced with node-pg and pg-promise libraries.

On the UI side, the main idea is to keep the visual layout simple, striking and intuitive for the user.
